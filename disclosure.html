      <p>
        Otaku Treasures participates in various affiliate marketing programs,
        including but not limited to the
        <strong>Amazon.in Associates Program</strong>. This means we may earn
        commissions on qualifying purchases made through our links â€” at no extra
        cost to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases. This does not
        impact the price you pay and supports our ability to continue producing
        quality otaku content.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only recommend products we genuinely love, ranging from anime figures
        to must-read manga. Our editorial choices remain independent and are
        based on fan appeal and authenticity.
